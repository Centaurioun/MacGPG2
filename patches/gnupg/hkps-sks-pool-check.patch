# dirmngr only loads the system certificates via gnutls if no custom cert is
# configured via hkp-cacert options and if the keyserver to be used is *not*
# the hkps pool server.
# However, in order to check if the current server is the pool, dirmngr doesn't
# check the current keyserver against 'hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net' but instead
# compares it aganst the value returned by get_default_keyserver (1).
# For the vanilla version of GnuPG this is no problem, since the hkps pool
# is the default keyserver.
#
# For MacGPG however, keys.openpgp.org is the default key server.
# This leads to the problem that instead of loading the system certificates for
# keys.openpgp.org â€“ since it is not the sks keyserver - it only loads the
# special sks-keyservers CA and will fail to connect to keys.openpgp.org
#
# This patch fixes this check by comparing the wanted keyserver against the
# domain of the hkps pool keyserver, which is how it should be.
