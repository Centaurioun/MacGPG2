# On macOS Monterey with Xcode 13.3, building gnutls segfaults
# since two different -march arguments are passed during build.
# Once -march=armv8.2-a and later based on the Makefile.in file
# in `lib/accelerated/aarch64` with -march=all
#
# The segfault is gone if -march=all is not passed, thus
# that option is removed from Makefile.in prior to building.
